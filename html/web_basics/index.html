		<p> I am using the "p" tag here, although it won't end up being a paragraph. I can hopefully eat up enough text here to use up a couple of lines at least by droning on and on.</p>

		<p><strong>This is giving this text strong importance according to the documentation, so it had better in bold!</strong></p>

			<p><em> EM tag is supposed to display text in italics but shouldn't be used to <strong>create (strong tag within em tags)</strong> italic text because it has stress emphasis, whereas italics should be done with CSS.</em></p>

<p>An unordered list appears!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Containing several unordered items!</li>
