# Git Definitions - Matt Mayerle (Chicago Fiddler Crabs) Edits

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is like a timeline that allows us to view the history and changes made to one of more files by multiple users. Multiple users can merge changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	Branches give the programmer a copy of the software to edit and tinker with independent of the actual piece of software, and then merge these changes back into the software. Multiple users are allowed to work on different versions of the same software.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	Commits are a saved change which has a unique ID, the author's name, a timestamp, and attached message. A good commit message outlines what changes were made compared to the previous file commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
	Merge conflicts often occur when a portion of code in the same place of a given file is edited by two different people and Github doesn't know which change to incorporate into the final file. Merge conflicts can also occur when one programmer changes the content of a file that another programmer has decided to delete.
