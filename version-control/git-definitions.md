# Git Definitions


* What is version control? Is a way to see all of the code that you have written to date and captures specific instances when something is changed and what is changed.
  Why is it useful? It is useful because it allows you to go back through those previous version, and have a better understanding of what was changed. You can then decide to revert back to those changes, or continue on.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a "copy" of code that allows you to work on code without impacting the "master" file. It allows multiple people to work on various versions/sections of the code, without impacting the main content.
* What is a commit? A commit is when you push/ merge a branch with the master file. It means you have completed the section of work you were doing and are ready to make it live. 
What makes a good commit message? A good commit message is one that provided enough detials to make someone understand exactly what was changed and even some of the why. 
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when there are competing line changes from different branches.
